        Create a table in the database.

        Parameters:
            table_name (str): The name of the table to create.
            schema (dict): A dictionary defining the table schema, where keys are column names

            ValueError: If the table already exists and `force` is set to False.

        Notes:
            - If `force` is True and the table exists, it will be dropped before creation.
